## :bangbang:  Before forking this repo (please read!) :bangbang:

As a full stack web developer, it was always hard for me to come up with good looking designs to show case my programming skills. I made this open source project for us. My goal is to provide backend and front end devolopers with a tool to showcase their information and work in a modern mobile first responsive design. **All I ask of you all is to use it with attribution.**


make sure to check <a href="https://tailwindui.com/license" target="_blank">tailwindui</a>  and acquire the correct license to use their components.
